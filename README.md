# championship-interface 🏆

I did this project especially for practice my habilities with pure CSS\
I have studied CSS with some youtube simple web projects,\
but this time I would like to solve a real problem of mine.\
Then I did an web page of my condominium championship,\
to put each sport together at the same place, once it was done on papers before\
Now it's easier to make the submission for our neighbourhood competition.

## how to run the project?

you can access my web page through this link: <https://cadu-code.github.io/championship-interface/> 

## features to add posteriorly...

* integrate a database
* enable the login system
* make it functional

## development curiosity❗

There is no flexbox in this project.

## what I have learned? 🧠

I've improved my habilities on structure a web page, I learn how to centralize the content\
or align with the sides. I also learned how to add navigational pages inside our site\ 
and now I know some basic forms develop habilities.
